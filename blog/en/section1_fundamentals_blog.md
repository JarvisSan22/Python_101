## Introduction to Python

**Kurumi**: Hey Jarvis! I heard you're really good with computers. I want to learn programming, but I have no idea where to start.

**Jarvis**: Hi Kurumi! That's great to hear. Programming is an amazing skill to learn. If you're just starting out, Python is one of the best languages to begin with.

**Kurumi**: Python? Like the snake? Why is it called that?

**Jarvis**: *laughs* Yes, it's named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, not the snake! The creator, Guido van Rossum, was a fan of the comedy show. Python was designed to be easy to read and fun to use.

**Kurumi**: That sounds perfect for me! But what makes Python better for beginners than other programming languages?

**Jarvis**: Great question! Python has a clean, simple syntax that reads almost like English. It doesn't have complicated symbols or strict rules like some other languages. Plus, it's incredibly versatile - you can use it for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and even image processing, which is what your advanced course will cover later.

**Kurumi**: Wow, that's impressive! So I could analyze data about my favorite Japanese fish with Python?

**Jarvis**: Absolutely! In fact, let's use Japanese fish as examples throughout our learning journey. It'll make the concepts more relatable and fun for you.

## Getting Started with Python

**Kurumi**: So how do I actually start using Python?

**Jarvis**: First, you need to install Python on your computer. Then you can write code in several ways: using the interactive shell for quick experiments, creating script files with a .py extension, or using Jupyter notebooks which combine code, text, and visualizations - like the notebook we've prepared for this course.

**Kurumi**: That sounds manageable. What's the first thing everyone learns in programming?

**Jarvis**: The classic first program is printing "Hello, World!" Let me show you:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Kurumi**: That's it? Just one line? I expected programming to be more complicated!

**Jarvis**: That's the beauty of Python! Let's try something more relevant to our theme:

```python
print("Hello, I love Japanese fish!")
```

**Kurumi**: *giggles* I can do that! What's next?

## Variables and Data Types

**Jarvis**: Next, we'll learn about variables. Think of variables as labeled containers that store information. For example:

```python
fish_name = "Koi"
fish_age = 3
fish_weight = 2.5
is_colorful = True
```

**Kurumi**: I see! So `fish_name` holds the text "Koi", `fish_age` is the number 3, `fish_weight` is 2.5, and `is_colorful` is True. Are these different types of data?

**Jarvis**: Exactly! You've just identified the basic data types in Python:
- Strings (text): like `"Koi"`
- Integers (whole numbers): like `3`
- Floats (decimal numbers): like `2.5`
- Booleans (True/False values): like `True`

**Kurumi**: What can I do with these variables once I've created them?

**Jarvis**: You can use them in calculations, display them, modify them, compare them - all sorts of operations! Let's see some examples:

```python
# Arithmetic with variables
total_fish = 5
new_fish = 3
all_fish = total_fish + new_fish
print(f"I now have {all_fish} fish in my pond.")

# Modifying variables
fish_weight = 1.2  # kg
fish_weight = fish_weight + 0.3  # fish grew by 0.3 kg
print(f"The fish now weighs {fish_weight} kg.")

# String operations
fish_type = "Maguro"  # Tuna in Japanese
print(f"I love eating {fish_type} sashimi!")
print(f"The word {fish_type} has {len(fish_type)} letters.")
```

**Kurumi**: The `f` before the quotes in `print(f"...")` - what does that do?

**Jarvis**: That's an f-string, a convenient way to embed variables inside text. The `f` tells Python to look for variables inside the curly braces `{}` and insert their values.

## Operators in Python

**Kurumi**: You mentioned calculations. What kinds of math can Python do?

**Jarvis**: Python supports all the standard mathematical operations:

```python
# Basic arithmetic
a = 10
b = 3

print(f"Addition: {a + b}")        # 13
print(f"Subtraction: {a - b}")     # 7
print(f"Multiplication: {a * b}")  # 30
print(f"Division: {a / b}")        # 3.3333...
print(f"Floor division: {a // b}") # 3 (division without remainder)
print(f"Modulus: {a % b}")         # 1 (remainder of division)
print(f"Exponentiation: {a ** b}") # 1000 (10 to the power of 3)
```

**Kurumi**: That's handy! What about comparing things? Like checking if one fish is bigger than another?

**Jarvis**: Those are comparison operators, and they return Boolean values (True or False):

```python
koi_weight = 2.5
fugu_weight = 1.8

print(f"Is Koi heavier? {koi_weight > fugu_weight}")  # True
print(f"Are they the same weight? {koi_weight == fugu_weight}")  # False
print(f"Is Fugu lighter? {fugu_weight < koi_weight}")  # True
```

**Kurumi**: I notice you used `==` for checking equality, not just `=`. Is that important?

**Jarvis**: Very observant! In Python, `=` is used for assignment (setting a variable's value), while `==` is used for comparison (checking if two values are equal). Mixing them up is a common beginner mistake.

## Making Decisions with Conditional Statements

**Kurumi**: In real life, we make different decisions based on different situations. Can Python do that too?

**Jarvis**: Absolutely! That's what conditional statements are for. The most common is the `if` statement:

```python
fish_type = "Fugu"  # Pufferfish

if fish_type == "Fugu":
    print("Be careful! Fugu must be prepared by a licensed chef.")
```

**Kurumi**: What if I want to do one thing if a condition is true, and something else if it's false?

**Jarvis**: Then you'd use an `if-else` statement:

```python
water_temp = 25  # Celsius

if water_temp > 28:
    print("Water is too warm for Koi fish.")
else:
    print("Water temperature is suitable for Koi fish.")
```

**Kurumi**: What if there are multiple conditions to check?

**Jarvis**: That's where `elif` (short for "else if") comes in:

```python
fish_type = "Tai"  # Sea bream

if fish_type == "Fugu":
    print("Fugu (pufferfish) must be prepared carefully due to toxins.")
elif fish_type == "Tai":
    print("Tai (sea bream) is often served on celebratory occasions in Japan.")
elif fish_type == "Koi":
    print("Koi are ornamental fish, not typically eaten.")
else:
    print("Information about this fish type is not available.")
```

**Kurumi**: I see! So Python checks each condition in order, and executes the code block for the first condition that's true.

**Jarvis**: Exactly! And if none of the conditions are true, it executes the `else` block, if there is one.

## Repeating Actions with Loops

**Kurumi**: What if I want to do the same thing multiple times? Like printing information about several fish?

**Jarvis**: That's where loops come in. Python has two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

**Kurumi**: What's the difference?

**Jarvis**: A `for` loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something. A `while` loop continues as long as a certain condition remains true.

**Kurumi**: Can you show me examples?

**Jarvis**: Sure! Here's a `for` loop that iterates through a list of fish:

```python
japanese_fish = ["Koi", "Fugu", "Tai", "Maguro", "Unagi"]

print("List of Japanese fish:")
for fish in japanese_fish:
    print(f"- {fish}")
```

And here's a `while` loop that simulates heating water until it reaches a target temperature:

```python
water_temp = 20
target_temp = 25

print("Heating water...")
while water_temp < target_temp:
    print(f"Current water temperature: {water_temp}째C")
    water_temp += 1

print(f"Target temperature reached: {water_temp}째C")
```

**Kurumi**: That makes sense! The `for` loop goes through each fish in the list, and the `while` loop keeps running until the water temperature reaches 25째C.

**Jarvis**: Exactly! Loops are incredibly useful for automating repetitive tasks.

## Loop Control Statements

**Kurumi**: What if I want to stop a loop early, or skip certain iterations?

**Jarvis**: Python provides two special statements for that: `break` and `continue`.

**Kurumi**: How do they work?

**Jarvis**: `break` immediately exits the loop, while `continue` skips to the next iteration. Let me show you:

```python
# Using break
fish_types = ["Koi", "Fugu", "Tai", "Maguro", "Unagi"]

print("Searching for Fugu...")
for fish in fish_types:
    print(f"Checking: {fish}")
    if fish == "Fugu":
        print("Found Fugu! Stopping search.")
        break  # Exit the loop when Fugu is found
```

```python
# Using continue
print("Processing fish (skipping Fugu):")
for fish in fish_types:
    if fish == "Fugu":
        print(f"Skipping {fish} as it requires special handling")
        continue  # Skip to the next iteration
    print(f"Processing: {fish}")
```

**Kurumi**: I see! `break` is like saying "I'm done with this entire loop," while `continue` is like saying "I'm done with this particular iteration, let's move on to the next one."

**Jarvis**: That's a perfect way to think about it!

## Putting It All Together

**Kurumi**: This is all really interesting, but how do these concepts work together in a real program?

**Jarvis**: Let's create a simple fish pond simulation that uses variables, conditionals, and loops:

```python
# Fish pond simulation
pond_fish = ["Koi", "Koi", "Goldfish", "Koi", "Goldfish"]
temperature = 22
is_sunny = True

# Display initial state
print(f"Fish pond has {len(pond_fish)} fish")
print(f"Water temperature is {temperature}째C")

# Conditional logic
if temperature > 25:
    print("Warning: Water is getting too warm")
elif temperature < 15:
    print("Warning: Water is too cold")
else:
    print("Temperature is in the optimal range")

# Loop through and count fish types
koi_count = 0
goldfish_count = 0

for fish in pond_fish:
    if fish == "Koi":
        koi_count += 1
    elif fish == "Goldfish":
        goldfish_count += 1

print(f"The pond contains {koi_count} Koi and {goldfish_count} Goldfish")

# Simulate temperature changes over time
print("\nSimulating temperature changes:")
day = 1
while day <= 5:
    if is_sunny:
        temperature += 2
    else:
        temperature -= 1
    
    print(f"Day {day}: Temperature is now {temperature}째C")
    
    if temperature > 28:
        print("Alert! Water too hot, turning on cooling system")
        temperature -= 3
        
    # Toggle weather condition
    is_sunny = not is_sunny
    day += 1
```

**Kurumi**: Wow, that's cool! I can see how all the concepts come together to create something useful.

**Jarvis**: Exactly! And this is just scratching the surface. As you continue learning Python, you'll discover even more powerful features and techniques.
