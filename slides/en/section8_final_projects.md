- Apply at least 3 different image transformations:
  - Resize/crop
  - Adjust brightness/contrast
  - Apply filters (blur, sharpen, etc.)
  - Convert to grayscale/sepia
- Save processed images
- Include proper error handling
- Document code thoroughly

---

### Implementation Steps

1. Set up project structure
2. Install required libraries
3. Create functions for image loading/saving
4. Implement image processing functions
5. Build user interface
6. Add error handling
7. Test with various images
8. Document code and usage

---

### Sample Code: Loading an Image

```python
from PIL import Image

def load_image(file_path):
    """
    Load an image from the specified file path.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the image file
        
    Returns:
        PIL.Image: Loaded image object
    """
    try:
        img = Image.open(file_path)
        return img
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading image: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
koi_image = load_image("japanese_koi.jpg")
if koi_image:
    koi_image.show()
```

---

### Sample Code: Image Processing

```python
def apply_grayscale(image):
    """Convert image to grayscale."""
    return image.convert("L")

def resize_image(image, width, height):
    """Resize image to specified dimensions."""
    return image.resize((width, height))

def adjust_brightness(image, factor):
    """Adjust image brightness by factor (0.0-2.0)."""
    from PIL import ImageEnhance
    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Brightness(image)
    return enhancer.enhance(factor)
```

---

### Testing Your Application

        return data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading data: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
fish_data = load_fish_data("japanese_fish.csv")
if fish_data is not None:
    print(fish_data.head())
```

---

### Sample Code: Data Analysis

```python
def calculate_statistics(data, column):
    """Calculate basic statistics for a column."""
    stats = {
        "mean": data[column].mean(),
        "median": data[column].median(),
        "min": data[column].min(),
        "max": data[column].max(),
        "std": data[column].std()
    }
    return stats

def filter_by_species(data, species):
    """Filter data by fish species."""
    return data[data["species"] == species]
```

---

### Sample Code: Data Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_weight_distribution(data):
    """Create a histogram of fish weights."""
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.hist(data["weight"], bins=10, alpha=0.7)
    plt.title("Fish Weight Distribution")
    plt.xlabel("Weight (kg)")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency")
